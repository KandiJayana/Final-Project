# Individual Self-Assessment


## Self-Assessment:
I was able to think through or forecast potential impediments and break down obstacles into our deliverables. I used my communication and solve problems skills to get the team together and explain options, ideas, and solutions that we could probably work with. I encourage myself and my team members many times to share their ideas in brainstorming sessions.
- #### Strengths:
I have strong interpersonal and communication skills that help me identify the best approach/solution to take with colleagues.
I’ve excelled at improving my online communication skills by contacting colleagues on Slack, asking for help, or communicating concerns and delays which helped a lot to stay on track with our project.
- #### Area to Improve: 
I can struggle to communicate my ideas or concerns clearly when I’m stressed. I believe that writing things down helps me formulate my thoughts, so I’d like to improve on this area and consider making a few notes before sharing my results or opinion.

## Team Assessment:
I exceeded my expectations about communication and cooperation with my team members. From the beginning, when I invited the people that I had previously worked together in the breakout rooms, I tried to make the team members feel comfortable with each other and share their strongest skills that would help us divide all of the work. We ended up deciding that each member would be doing some of the things in all of the steps. This way, we wouldn't centralize or overwork any person with part of the deliverables. 

- #### Strengths:
 I can say that working cross-functionally helped us produce better outcomes in the final project and overcome our presentation. We also excel at incorporating last-minute changes to our project, especially because we had realized during the second deliverable that our dataset needed to be changed because it would not be enough to train our machine learning model. We were able to remain calm and quickly rework our deliverable based on the new dataset we had found.  
- #### Area to Improve:
 Track better our timing and progress as we worked on multiple tasks together and had to change a lot of the worked each of us had done
 
 ## Summary of Credit Card Approval Predictions Project:
 - We chose this topic because we believe that credit cards are beneficial for both monetary reasons and convenience.
 - We created a Machine learning model that helped us predict whether an applicant would be approved for a credit or not and which factors were determining it. 
 - In the machine learning part, we used the RandomForest Classifier, which gave us 88% of accuracy.
 - We used Tableau to cover part of our visualization.
 - We were able to answer the initial questions and confirm our machine learning model after seeing the trends that we created on our dashboards. 
 - We also made some recomendatios for future analysis.
